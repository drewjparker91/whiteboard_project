//Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, 
//demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53]
Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

function removeDuplicates(arr){ 
  return [...new Set(arr)] 
}

//utilize built in set object
//pass input array into function
//create a new array as a Set Object as the input array
//should strings be case sensitive?
